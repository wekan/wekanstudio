## All Boards

This page is similar to `All Boards` page of WeKan Open Source kanban https://wekan.github.io

Currently I'm learning how to get webpages of apps visible in all web browsers:
1. Modern browsers.
2. Maintained browsers, like Amiga IBrowse, Netsurf.
3. Text browsers, like ELinks, w3m.
3. Legacy browsers, like IE5, Netscape.



Steps:

1. I converted some Font Awesome icons https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/ to PNG at https://fa2png.app
2. With GIMP, I converted PNG to GIF. GIF files are smaller than PNG.
3. I added some of those icons inside of HTML buttons.
4. I used KompoZer https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/files/current/0.8b3/ to create UI layout with tables, and then cleaned up that HTML.
5. I can modified GIF files with GIMP, for example rotating image 90 decrees clocwise.
   That kind of icon did not exist previously at Font Awesome.
   This is about getting back ability to modify icons easily.
6. I only use those GIF icons visible at webpage, resulting to smaller size, faster loading pages.
   No need to have all of Font Awesome.
7. Profit, because of faster loader pages, and smaller bandwidth bills.
